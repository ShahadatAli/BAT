# Canteen Management System for BAT Bangladesh

This is a Canteen Management System software custom-developed for British American Tobacco Bangladesh.
<br/>The project has 2 parts:<br/>
**1. Meal Counter**
In this part of the software, employees press their RFID employee cards onto the RFID scanners set in the canteen of the Savar Factory. It was developed with the aim to have an exact meal count which would reduce food wastage eventually.

**2. Meal History Dashboard**
<br/>In this part, admins and super admins can check and get a list of the meals taken by each employees in each meal time. This part of the software provides detailed information about employees' meals and orders(was planned for the next phase of the project) so that the admins can determine the meals needed each day, each meal time.
