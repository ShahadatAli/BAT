# Canteen Management System for BAT Bangladesh

This is a Canteen Management System software custom-developed for British American Tobacco Bangladesh.
The project has 2 parts:
**1. Meal Counter**
In this part of the software, employees press their RFID employee cards onto the RFID scanners set in the canteen of the Savar Factory. It was developed with the aim to have an exact meal count which would reduce food wastage eventually.
